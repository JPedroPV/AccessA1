<H5>What is this</H5>
More specifically, I am interested in computer hardware and building cool computers with it. 
<H5>My History With This</H5>
I've been building computers for myself and those close to me since the age of 14 and enjoy keeping up with the newest trends in consumer computer parts.
<H5>How do I enjoy this</H5>
For the most part enjoy keeping up with the newest trends in consumer computer parts. Reading about other's builds and taking inspiration on websites like <a HREF="https://www.pcpartpicker.com">pcpartpicker.com</a>
